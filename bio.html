                While growing up he used to sleep with his brother in living room of cramped family room. Pichai's
                
                father was working at itish International GEC. His father saw that he needs a good education for
                
                the
                better future. Pichai had good memory power with the telephone numbers. Once he knew the telephone
                
                numbers
                he would never forget it. Pichai from the very young age showed interest in Technology. His father
                
                was aware
                that Sundar should get good education so when he was supposed to go America for his studies at 
                Stanford though
                his father couldnt afford the flight for America yet he went and completed his Studies 
            </p>
            <p>According to Pichai 3 things had changed his life a fridge, TV and Telephone. As mentioned earlier
                
                Pichai was
                interested in Technology. He noticed that when the telephone the first device which came to his home
                
                made his
                father's work easier. Before that his father used to go to phone booth for calling it used to take
                
                30 mins to
                go to the booth, 30 mins to wait for the turn and more 30 mins to come back home but when the 
                telephone came in
                his house he could do it in some mins or seconds. From the incident Sundar knew that technology 
                saves time and

                great success in browser no Microsoft will surely launch their search engine as well so he and 
                his team started working on the project of the new browser and the day finally came when Microsoft
                launched bing and Google launched Chrome and after launch of Chrome all other browsers are dead
                after those successfull decisions Microsoft was having a look at him they finally offered him the 
                job of CEO for Microsoft and Pichai went to his manager and said that he got the offer in Microsoft
                firstly his manager thought to let him go but later when google did the survey about him 99.9% of 
                google employee told that he should be in Google and Google cant run without Pichai. After that in 2015
                Google made him CEO gave him bonus and also some stake in company. Microsoft later made Satya Nadela 
                their CEO.</p>
